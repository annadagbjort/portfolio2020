                    <p class=""> We created a brand awareness video for Foodsharing Copenhagen. <br>
                        We started with making a Title, Theme, Logline and a Treatment. Then we moved on to making the storyboard. After making the first storyboard we realised our video was too long and complex so we ended up changing the project from what we had decided when making the Treatment. I was an active part of all this and then I filmed the video. But was not a part of the editing. <br> It was our first video project so we learned a lot on the way.</p>

                        The protagonist goes to the fridge and takes out eggs. He puts them in a bowl of water and watches if they float or sink. The narrator explains the trick to test if eggs are still good enough to eat. </p>
                    <p>

                        The protagonist then takes out milk that has become a bit sour and pours into a bowl with flour and starts stirring. The narrator explains how you can know if milk has gone bad and how to use milk that has become sour. </p>
                    <p>

                        The protagonist then takes apples that do not look very good and slices them up and adds them on top of a pie crust. The narrator explains what you can use old apples for. </p>
                    <p>

                        Next, the protagonist takes bread out of the pantry and feels it, noticing it is hard. Instead of throwing it away, he pours some water over it, wraps it in tin foil, and puts it in the oven for 10 minutes. The narrator explains the trick about how to make bread soft again. The protagonist takes the bread out of the oven, feels it, and it is soft again. </p>
                    <p>

                        The protagonist then takes out cheese that has mold, cuts away the mold and slices the cheese and puts on a slice of bread. The narrator explains that you can simply cut away the mold and the rest of the cheese is still in good condition </p>

                        The protagonist goes to Foodshare Copenhagen, gets a ticket, walks around the market, and leaves with delicious food FOR FREE! The narrator explains how each piece of the market works and what a benefit it is to go to it.</p>
